# OOP-project
Welcome to the Hospital Management System repository! This project is a comprehensive C++ implementation of a Hospital Management System, designed and developed with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
SmartHealth: Integrated Hospital Management System with EHR
SmartHealth goes beyond conventional Hospital Management Systems by incorporating Electronic Health Records (EHR) functionality, enriching the patient and doctor experience. This C++ project, built on robust Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, seamlessly integrates IoT sensor data, appointment management, and secure EHR storage. Let's explore the expanded features:

Features:
1. Patient-Centric Features:
Appointment Booking: Patients can effortlessly schedule appointments, minimizing waiting times and optimizing their healthcare experience.

Medical Records Access: Comprehensive access to Electronic Health Records, spanning the last three months, providing a detailed historical overview of medical treatments, medications, and illnesses.

IoT Sensor Integration: Real-time data from IoT sensors, such as patient movement, is processed and incorporated into EHR for a comprehensive understanding of patient health.

2. IoT Sensor Data Processing:
Data Calculation: The system intelligently processes IoT sensor data, extracting valuable insights to aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
3. Doctor-Centric Features:
Appointment Management: Doctors efficiently manage appointments, approve bookings, and access EHR for a complete patient history analysis.

Patient Reports: Access to detailed patient reports, including EHR data, enabling doctors to offer personalized and effective medical care.

4. RMC2 Integration:
Centralized Management: RMC2 acts as the central hub for coordinating hospital operations, integrating IoT data, and managing EHR securely.

Data Security: EHR data, encompassing the last three months, is stored securely with encryption, ensuring patient confidentiality and compliance with privacy regulations.

Binary File Handling: Efficient binary file handling optimizes the storage and retrieval of patient records, IoT sensor data, and EHR information.
